# iFrame-bypass
Simple iFrame (bypass) html page generator

Starting from a list of url (one per line inside url.txt file), this script will generate an HTML page that embed all the urls as iframe. Useful to bulk check lot of urls.
The second script will do the same but tries to bypass the X-Frame-Option header.
